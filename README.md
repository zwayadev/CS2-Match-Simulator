CS2 Match Simulator

------------------------------------------------------

CS2 Match Simulator is a C++ program that helps you simulate real CS2 matches
as well as imaginary matches of imaginary teams.

You can set team names, map name and the strength of teams.

This match simulator offers the simulated result of the match as well as results
of both halves of the match.

HOW TO USE

1) After you run the program you will get following messages:

**---------------------------
|   CS2 SCORE PREDICTOR   |
---------------------------

Enter Team Name 1:**

2) Under **"Team Name 1:"** type the name of the first team and press enter.
After that you should get this message:

**Enter Team Name 2:**

3)  Under **"Team Name 2:"** type the name of the second team and press enter.
After that you should get this message:

**Enter Map Name: de_**

4) Under **"de_"** type  the name of the map that you want to be simulated.
**Keep in mind not to press space before writing the name of the map as it will be
later copied as "de_ mapname"**
After that you should get this message:

**Strength of Team 1 (Lowest 0, Highest 100):**

5) Under **"Strength of Team 1 (Lowest 0, Highest 100):"** you should write the strength
of the first team you entered.
**YOU MUST WRITE A VALUE OF 0-100 OTHERWISE THE PROGRAM WILL TURN OFF IMMEDIATELY**
**KEEP IN MIND THIS IS THE STRENGTH OF TEAM 1 AND THE STRENGTH OF TEAM 2 IS PROPORTIONAL
*(e.g If Team 1's strength is 70 then Team 2's strength will be 30)***

6) If you followed everything correctly then you should get your result.
e.g:

**---------------------------------
       Team 1 13 - 5 Team 2
          MAP de_mapname MAP
---------------------------------
           11 First Half 1
            2 Second Half 4
---------------------------------**

7) Press any key to exit the program
